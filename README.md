## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Olav007/Olav007** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

This profile is mostly private stuff that is public because it is easier that way.

I have one repository, meditation-timer, which is meant for sharing.

powerplant-coding-challenge and TempControl are coding challenges.
